# LCDCache Library Bug Fixes - Version 1.1.0

## Overview
This document outlines all the critical bugs that were fixed in LCDCache version 1.1.0.

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Memory Leak in Destructor
**Issue**: The destructor was not properly freeing `RunList` objects that were currently in use in the cache.
**Fix**: Modified destructor to iterate through all rows and free all `RunList` objects before freeing pooled objects.
**Impact**: Prevents memory leaks that would accumulate over time with frequent pixel operations.

### 2. Race Condition in tryLock() Method
**Issue**: Race condition between checking `!locked` and setting `locked = true` could allow multiple tasks to acquire the lock.
**Fix**: Improved the atomic operation handling and added better timeout checking with separate variable for current time.
**Impact**: Prevents data corruption in multi-threaded environments.

### 3. Inconsistent Bounds Checking
**Issue**: `getPixel()` method only checked y-coordinate bounds, not x-coordinate bounds.
**Fix**: Added complete bounds checking for both x and y coordinates in `getPixel()` method.
**Impact**: Prevents potential access to invalid memory locations.

### 4. Integer Overflow in Run Splitting
**Issue**: Arithmetic operations in run splitting logic could cause integer overflow.
**Fix**: Added overflow protection checks before performing arithmetic operations.
**Impact**: Prevents undefined behavior and potential crashes.

### 5. Integer Overflow in addRun() Method
**Issue**: Run merging and length calculations could cause integer overflow.
**Fix**: Added bounds checking and used 32-bit arithmetic for overflow-prone operations.
**Impact**: Prevents undefined behavior when dealing with large runs.

### 6. Color ID Overflow
**Issue**: No protection against color ID overflow when registering too many unique colors.
**Fix**: Added check to prevent color ID overflow and return background color ID as fallback.
**Impact**: Prevents crashes when too many unique colors are used.

### 7. Memory Allocation Failure Handling
**Issue**: No error handling for memory allocation failures in `setPixel()` method.
**Fix**: Added null pointer check after `new` operations and graceful error handling.
**Impact**: Prevents crashes when memory allocation fails.

## Minor Improvements

### 8. Thread-Safe Method Versions
**Addition**: Added `setPixelSafe()`, `getPixelSafe()`, `clearSafe()`, and `setBackgroundColorSafe()` methods that automatically handle locking.
**Impact**: Provides easier-to-use thread-safe alternatives for common operations.

### 9. Better Documentation
**Improvement**: Updated documentation to reflect the fixes and added version information.
**Impact**: Better user understanding of the library's capabilities and limitations.

## Usage Recommendations

### For Single-Threaded Applications
- Use the standard methods: `setPixel()`, `getPixel()`, `clear()`, etc.
- No locking required

### For Multi-Threaded Applications
- Use the thread-safe methods: `setPixelSafe()`, `getPixelSafe()`, `clearSafe()`, etc.
- Or manually use `lock()`/`unlock()` with standard methods
- Always ensure proper locking to prevent race conditions

### Memory Management
- The library now properly manages memory and prevents leaks
- No manual memory management required
- Background pixels are automatically optimized out

### Performance Considerations
- Run-length encoding provides excellent compression for displays with repeated colors
- Dirty row tracking minimizes unnecessary display updates
- Thread-safe methods have minimal overhead

## Migration from Version 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes
- None. All existing code should work without modification.

### Recommended Changes
- Consider using thread-safe methods in multi-threaded applications
- No other changes required

## Testing

The fixes have been tested for:
- Memory leak prevention
- Thread safety in concurrent access scenarios
- Bounds checking with edge cases
- Integer overflow protection
- Memory allocation failure handling

## Version History

- **1.0.0**: Initial release
